# README - Beat 'Em Up Prototype

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the implemented features in the "Beat 'Em Up" game prototype. The prototype demonstrates core mechanics, physics interactions, UI elements, and custom AI behaviors.

## Core Mechanic
- **Portal System**: Players can create entry and exit portals to teleport between different locations in the game. Portals are generated by the player character and have a cooldown mechanism to prevent spamming.

## Controls
- **E**: Activate grappling hook
- **F**: Pick up grenade
- **G**: Throw grenade
- **Q**: Initiate portal creation at current location
- **Q**: Set exit portal at current location if there is already a Entry Portal

## Physics Interactions
1. **Grappling Hook**: 
   - **Usage**: Activated by pressing 'E'. The grappling hook can be used to pull the player towards a point or drag objects/enemies towards the player.
   - **Momentum Conservation**: The grappling hook conserves the player's momentum, allowing for dynamic movements such as launching over objects. For effective use, jump right before the hook attaches to the object.
   - **Rope Cut Mechanic**: The rope will automatically cut if the player's viewing angle with respect to the hook's attachment point exceeds 90 degrees, adding a layer of strategy to its use.
2. **Grenade System**: Allows throwing grenades that interact physically with the environment and enemies.
3. **Wrecking Ball**: Implemented using a physics constraint component; it demonstrates a hinge mechanism allowing the ball to swing and impact the environment and enemies dynamically.


## User Interface
- **Main Menu**: Basic menu with options to start the game, and exit.
- **In-Game UI**:
  - Mini-map: Located at the bottom right of the screen.
  - Enemy Status Indicators: Display health bars and awareness icons (exclamation mark for spotted, question mark for investigating).

## Artificial Intelligence
- **Custom AI Navigation**: Enemies use a navigation mesh to move around the environment. They can investigate areas where they last saw the player and communicate with nearby allies to alert them of the player's presence.
- **Behavior Tree**: Includes behaviors for patrolling, chasing, and investigating sounds.

## Additional Information
- **Debugging**: Debug mode can be enabled in the blueprint settings (`BP_ThirdPersonCharacter` -> Development Settings -> Enable Debug). This is set to 'false' by default but can be enabled for detailed in-game debugging during evaluation.

## Notes for TA
Please ensure that all game mechanics are tested both individually and in combination to assess the smooth integration and interaction within the game. The debugging mode can provide additional insights into the AI decision processes and physics calculations.
