# README - Beat 'Em Up Prototype

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the implemented features in the "Beat 'Em Up" game prototype. The prototype demonstrates core mechanics, physics interactions, UI elements, and custom AI behaviors.

## Core Mechanics
- **Portal System**: Players can create entry and exit portals to teleport between different locations in the game. Portals are generated by the player character and have a cooldown mechanism to prevent spamming.
- **Reverse Time Mechanic**: Allows players to rewind the game state for a specified duration, enabling them to correct mistakes or try different strategies.

## Controls
- **E**: Activate grappling hook
- **F**: Pick up grenade
- **G**: Throw grenade
- **Q**: Initiate portal creation at current location
- **Q**: Set exit portal at current location if there is already an Entry Portal
- **R**: Activate Reverse Time mechanic

## Physics Interactions
1. **Grappling Hook**: 
   - **Usage**: Activated by pressing 'E'. The grappling hook can be used to pull the player towards a point or drag objects/enemies towards the player.
   - **Momentum Conservation**: The grappling hook conserves the player's momentum, allowing for dynamic movements such as launching over objects. For effective use, jump right before the hook attaches to the object.
   - **Rope Cut Mechanic**: The rope will automatically cut if the player's viewing angle with respect to the hook's attachment point exceeds 90 degrees, adding a layer of strategy to its use.
2. **Grenade System**: Allows throwing grenades that interact physically with the environment and enemies.
3. **Wrecking Ball**: Implemented using a physics constraint component; it demonstrates a hinge mechanism allowing the ball to swing and impact the environment and enemies dynamically.

## User Interface
- **Main Menu**: Basic menu with options to start the game and exit.
- **In-Game UI**:
  - Mini-map: Located at the bottom right of the screen.
  - Enemy Status Indicators: Display health bars and awareness icons (exclamation mark for spotted, question mark for investigating).

## Artificial Intelligence
- **Custom AI Navigation**: Enemies use a navigation mesh to move around the environment. They can investigate areas where they last saw the player and communicate with nearby allies to alert them of the player's presence.
- **Behavior Tree**: Includes behaviors for patrolling, chasing, and investigating sounds.

## Additional Information
- **Debugging**: Debug mode can be enabled in the blueprint settings (`BP_ThirdPersonCharacter` -> Development Settings -> Enable Debug). This is set to 'false' by default but can be enabled for detailed in-game debugging during evaluation.

## Saving & Loading
### Overview of Save Data
The save data system ensures players can continue their progress seamlessly across different play sessions. This system captures all relevant game state information, including player data, enemy states, grappling hook status, and portal configurations.

### Implementation of Saving and Loading
#### Saving Data:
- The Save function captures the current state of the game by recording the values of all relevant variables into a `UBeatEmUpSaveGame` object.
- Player data, enemy data, grappling hook status, and portal configurations are all saved to ensure the game state can be accurately restored.

#### Loading Data:
- The Load function restores the game state by reading the values from a `UBeatEmUpSaveGame` object and applying them to the current game session.
- This includes setting the player's position, health, experience, and orientation, respawning enemies with their correct states, and restoring the status of the grappling hook and portals.

By implementing this comprehensive save and load system, the game ensures a seamless and consistent player experience, allowing players to resume their progress without losing any important game state information.

## Dynamic Material
### Overview of Effect
The dynamic material system enhances visual feedback and immersion by providing real-time changes to material properties based on gameplay events. These dynamic materials respond to player actions, offering immediate visual cues that reflect the in-game status and interactions.

### Implemented Effects
- **Player Character**:
  - **Grappling Hook Activation**: Changes material properties to reflect activation.
  - **Portal Interaction**: Changes material properties during portal interaction.
- **Enemies**:
  - **Health-Based Changes**: Material changes based on health status.
  - **Ragdoll State**: Visual indicators for ragdoll effect.
- **Portals**:
  - **Inactive State**: Low glow effect.
  - **Active State**: High glow effect.

## Particle Effect
### Overview of Effect
The particle effect visually enhances the player's interaction with portals. By creating a dynamic, spark-like emission around the portals, the particle effect serves both aesthetic and functional purposes.

### Implemented Effect
- **Portal Particle Effect**: Activated when the portal is active, featuring spark-like particles that radiate around the portal.

## Lighting Effect
### Overview of Effect
The dynamic lighting effects enhance visual feedback and player immersion by providing real-time changes to light properties based on gameplay events.

### Implemented Effects
- **Teleport Light Effect**: Light follows the player character's location when entering a portal, changing intensity and color.
- **Grenade Light Effect**: Grenade emits a light that flashes with increasing frequency as the explosion time approaches, providing a visual cue for the impending explosion.
